	<h1>Simple Iris Classifier</h1>
 <p>This project is a simple example of how to build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers based on their measurements.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>The dataset used in this project is the famous "Iris" dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library in Python. This dataset contains the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width measurements for 150 iris flowers, along with their species (target variable).</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 and scikit-learn installed on your machine. You can install scikit-learn using pip:</p>

<pre><code>pip install scikit-learn</code></pre>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To run the model, simply run the <code>simple_iris_classifier.py</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>python simple_iris_classifier.py</code></pre>

<p>This will train a logistic regression model on the Iris dataset and evaluate its performance using 5-fold cross-validation. The average accuracy across all cross-validation folds will be printed to the console.</p>

 <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>

 <p>This project was inspired by the scikit-learn documentation and the famous "Iris" dataset.</p>
